## Hi there 👋

I'm Jason.

### Bottom Line Up Front:
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a [Bacon number](https://oracleofbacon.org/movielinks.php) of 3, and I have an [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) of 5.
- 💬 Interested in learning about your open software developer and data analysis positions


### My programming
I use python's capabilities in my day-to-day activities as a functional product owner.
In my current role, I write scripts which rely heavily on the following packages:
* re
* pathlib
* pandas

My team’s project currently relies almost entirely on local files, hence the use of regex and directory navigation enabled by re and pathlib.
My pandas use is focused on supporting my functional customers and teammates through filtering millions of rows of Excel and CSV, as well as data aggregation to bring multiple datasets into a single coherent base.

In previous roles, I’ve worked directly with databases by building queries, integrating them directly within my scripts via the sqlalchemy package, and converting the set into a user-executable file.

However, while browsing available career options, I realized
1. I don’t have any public evidence of my work (since it’s all on my employer’s system)
2. There are some things that I don’t do in my day-to-day that I could use practice

### Current focus
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Object Oriented Programming and practicing some oft-overlooked aspects of python
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with identifying when OOP is appropriate and when it’s more complex than necessary
